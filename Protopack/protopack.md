# Protopack
{:.no_toc}

## What is Protopack?
{:.no_toc}
The protopack is a compact high capacity wearable power solution for cosplays.
With a capacity of 100 watts it's ideal for many cosplay projects such as Protogens or Projects with many electrical components.


## How to build?
{:.no_toc}

**Source your components**

You'll need to purchase and provide the components and tools to put this project together.
You can find a guide for this on the [component list](components-guide.md).
It is possible to substitute components as long as they fit within the given specifications.
Compatibility can not be ensured when deviating from the linked components.

**Print the cases**

The main star of the show are the 3D printed components, which can be found on:[printables](https://printables.com), [cults3d](https://cults3d.com), [github](https://github.com/xb15) or [thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com).
These cases were optimised for FDM printing and full instructions can be found on the [3D Printing](3d-printing.md) page.

**Assemble your Protopack**

You can use our detailed [how to build](diy-guide.md) guide for instructions on assembling the Protopack.
Some soldering is required, for a quick breakdown on soldering you can use the following video:

## Where can I buy this?

This might change in the future.
